# GrovePi Zero Projects

## Home Weather Display

For this project connect:
* Grove RGB LCD Display to Port 2 of the GrovePi Zero
* Grove Temperature and Humidity Sensor to Port 3 of the GrovePi Zero

Run the program with `sudo python Home_Weather_Display.py`

## GrovePi LED Blink Example

This example uses the the [Grove LED Socket](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_LED_Socket_Kit).
* Connect the Grove LED to port D2 on the GrovePi Zero.

## GrovePi LED Fade Example

This example uses the the [Grove LED Socket](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_LED_Socket_Kit) and [Grove Rotary Angle sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Rotary_Angle_Sensor).
* Connect the Grove LED to port D2 on the GrovePi Zero.
* Connect the Grove Rotary Angle Sensor to port A2.  

## Twitter: Tweet the Weather

This example uses the Grove Sound sensor, the Grove Light Sensor, and the Gove Temperature sensor to read the room environment and broadcast the values on Twitter.
* Sound Sensor on port A0
* Light Sensor on port A1
* Temp Sensor on port D3

## Tilt Buzzer

This is an project using the Grove Switch, Buzzer and accelerometer from the GrovePi starter kit.

* The Accelerometer connects to the I2C Port
* The Buzzer Sensor connects to Port D3 of the GrovePi Zero
* The Switch Sensor connects to Port A0 on the GrovePi Zero

## Who's At the door
This project uses the GrovePi Zero, the Grove Ultrasonic Ranger, the Grove Relay, the Grove Buzzer, and the Raspberry Pi Camera to detect when someone enters your room and send you an e-mail with a picture of them.

* The ultrasonic sensor to the D3 Port on the GrovePi Zero
* The Relay to the A2 Port on the GrovePi Zero
* The Buzzer to A1 Port on the GrovePi Zero
